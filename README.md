I build things that work. Then I make them work better.

## How I build

Influenced by [steipete](https://github.com/steipete) and [DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh):

- Start with CLI. If it needs a UI, rethink it.
- Build what you need. Then share it.
- Two sentences or less. Can't explain it that simply? Too complicated.
- Days, not months. Overthinking kills more projects than bad code.
- Constraints are good. Infinite time and resources don't make better software.
- Boring code beats clever code. Stable and predictable wins.
